    <span>
      I graduated in chemical engineering in Brazil and spent two years working in the financial market at Bradesco, one of the largest banks in the country. I decided to change my academic path and migrate to the programming area, where I have been specializing in languages such as JavaScript and C for almost a year. I currently study at one of the best programming schools in the world, 42 Lisboa, and work as a front-end software developer at Card4B.
      On a personal level, I'm a chess and thinking games enthusiast, and I also do physical activities frequently, having practiced sports such as rugby, swimming, volleyball and soccer. I speak portuguese, english and I'm also learning french.
